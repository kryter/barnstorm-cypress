# Barnstorm Cypress

Barnstorm-Cypress provides an implementation of mechanics, pilots, and towers using the Cypress framework.  If you decide to switch to a different test framework, you can swap out this implementation for another barnstorm test framework implementation and you should not need to change your tests at all.  This makes it possible to transition to a different test framework even if you have hundreds of tests and it would not be feasible to change every test.
